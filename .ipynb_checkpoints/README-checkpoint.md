# Machine Learning Techniques for Credit Card Fraud Detection

Jupyter notebook for the medium article "Machine Learning Techniques for Credit Card Fraud Detection"

This notebook examines 4 commonly used machine learning models used for credit card fraud detection.These include:

1. Random Forest
2. CatBoost
3. Deep Neural Network (DNN)
4. Isolation Forest

To evaluate different machine learning methods for fraud detection, we use the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset that is publicly available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). This dataset contains multiple credit card transactions from European card holders in 2013. Many of the features found in this dataset are transformed using PCA, due to the fact that the original dataset contains sensitive personally identifiable information (PII).
